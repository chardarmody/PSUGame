# PSUGame
A simple java game created for my IST 240 class.

The scenario is based on the Pennsylvania State University system. A character (user can select an alien, the penn lion, or Guion Bluford) will be walking around the state of Pennsylvania and will enter five campuses, one at a time. At each campus, the character is faced with challenges such as answering questions, solving a puzzle, or playing a game. The character will collect points in each location. After five visits, the game will end. Then a final screen will be shown, displaying the character's rankings according to his/her performance.
